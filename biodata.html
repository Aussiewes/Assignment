   is my name. I'm twenty years old. Although I currently live in <b>Bandar Baru Bangi, Selangor</b>, I was born in Kuala Lumpur. I have six siblings, and I am the fourth. Now i am currently a last semester which is semester 5 student of<strong> UitM Rembau Diploma in Information Management program</strong> . Painting used to be my hobby, but now days I mainly listen to music. Since 2017, I have been a great admirer of<font color= " 3b74b4" face=" Sans-serif" > BTS</font>. The Kpop group BTS known as <u><em> Bangtan Sonyeondan </u></em>was founded in 2013.
   Since I'm young, I don't really know what my ambition is . And now i am interested in continue my degree in <font color= " 3b74b4" face=" Sans-serif" > <b>information computer system </b> </font>  since we are presently frequently familiar with <em>technology </em> and i believe that taking this course will help me to choose what i want to be since it has a wide range of job scope.
